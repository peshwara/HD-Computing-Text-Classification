P5 code used for procesing different files from training data set of 52 classes and it was found that the all-term testdata itself produced the highest accuaracy
most common terms among monograms, digrams and trigrams like a, i, the, were removed from testfiles as part of preprocessing buit it did not yeild any significant increase in efficiency
